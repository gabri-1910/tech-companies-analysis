A machine learning project to analyze the price and volume variation in selected Brazilian tech companies in the stock market

The project aims to analyze the following companies: Intelbras, Enjoei and Positivo, and compare them to the global variation regarding the Ibovespa index, the index related to the main stock exchange company in Brazil, the B3.

The first part of the project deals with a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) so we can get more familiar with the dataset used. In this step, we'll organize the data and study it, as well as go over the data itself. This step ends with some visualizations and charts to better express what we will find in the data.
After that, we'll get started with the preparations to implement a machine learning algorithm, such as dividing the training set and training the machine itself.
